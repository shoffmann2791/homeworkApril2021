    <h1>Hello my name is Sally Hoffmann</h1>
    <h2>Full Stack Web Developer in the Making</h2>
   
 
    <p>Hi! My name is Sally Hoffmann. 
        My background is in Business Sales and Retail Management. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Textiles and Apparel Management. 6 months ago I had a baby and my son has really motivated to better myself and our family’s future. My best friend had recently joined the IT world and also spoke so highly of it – she’s a Tester with a large company. I did some research and spoke with Savvy Coders, I knew then this was the program for me. 
        As a child I held an interest in designing websites. When I was elementary and middle school, I would stay up all night designing layouts on Myspace adding music and reformatting my site until it looked perfect. I have always had an eye for design and making things look good. I also held an interest in understanding the way things work.
        At Kohl’s during the holiday season different vendors would send cardboard display units that needed to be built. It was something everyone dreaded you would get paper cuts and it definitely wasn’t easy, however I would always be the first to volunteer to build them, I enjoyed the challenge! In the past 6 months I have spent most of my free time with my son Augustus and working out as a member of Burn Boot Camp. Before Augustus was born I spent time painting, taking my dog on adventures to different parks, remodeling different areas of my home and cooking. For my capstone project I would like to build a website similar to UBER, but it’s for movers. You basically will request a mover/ what size truck you will need and know your fees upfront. The movers will come to you through an easy website request. I would like to cater this toward retirement communities and partner with furniture stores to market the app. College students would be targeted as movers. You can accept or decline work, therefore you are not held accountable to specific hours, just what fits your schedule.</p>
    

    <p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
    <p>You could BREAK <br> the line, but it's not used very often these days.</p>
